## Names and Inspiration

The project was named based on two fascinating species from the animal kingdom: the **golden orb weaver** spider and the **imperial bromeliad**.

* **Backend: Golden orb weaver:**
  * Spiders weave complex webs to capture their prey, just as our system creates a "web" of contacts, connecting information and facilitating management.
  * The characteristic yellow silk of the golden orb weaver's web symbolizes the connection and interconnection between the system's data.

* **Frontend: Imperial bromeliad:**
  * There is a mutualistic relationship between spiders and bromeliads that inspires the idea of a beneficial and cooperative interaction between the user and the system.
  * The bromeliad, especially epiphytes, creates a unique microenvironment, hosting a diversity of life. Our system, like the bromeliad, offers a rich and organized environment for contact management.
